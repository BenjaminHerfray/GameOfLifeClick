Original Game of Life code by Dan Shiffman with the following refactorings:
1. Dead value is set to white, live value is set to black. This is how the original game was.
2. You can now click on a dead tile to make it alive or on a live tile to kill it. You can set yourself the objective of killing off all tiles by clicking.
